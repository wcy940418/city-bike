"How big should we make of and how many bikes should we throw in some citi bike stations"

This is an analysis of the Citi Bike management problem. Of all Citi Bike 
stations, we want to know which stations are the least balanced, so we can optimal
either the size or the pre-set bikes of some stations. With open data, we count
the leaving, entering and differences of these two values of every stations.
